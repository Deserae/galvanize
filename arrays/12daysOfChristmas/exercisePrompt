Due to budget cuts, we'll need to cut back on the days of Christmas in this song. Use a template string to produce the new song given the number of days as a number.

daysOfChristmas(5) should produce the following string:

	On the 1st day of Christmas my true love gave to me, a partridge in a pear tree
	On the 2nd day of Christmas my true love gave to me, two turtle doves and a partridge in a pear tree
	On the 3rd day of Christmas my true love gave to me, three french hens two turtle doves and a partridge in a pear tree
	On the 4th day of Christmas my true love gave to me, four calling birds three french hens two turtle doves and a partridge in a pear tree
	On the 5th day of Christmas my true love gave to me, five golden rings four calling birds three french hens two turtle doves and a partridge in a pear tree
