The purpose of this challenge is to write a function named camelize that will take one argument, a string containing a phrase consisting of one or more words, and returns a string of that phrase converted into lower camel case. For reference read up on camelCase here  Any punctuation in the original phrase should be ignored and not present in the answer, unless it is a -(hyphen) or an _(underscore). If given a string with no alphabetical characters, or an invalid data type, or nothing at all, return "Please enter a valid string."

For example, given the input "hello there", it should return "helloThere" Given the input "My name is Jeff", it should return "myNameIsJeff" Given the input "Who am I? Don't worry about it.", it should return "whoAmIDontWorryAboutIt" Given the input "Today is_the day!", it should return "todayIs_theDay"
